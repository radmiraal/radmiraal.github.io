title: Exploring the sender

Today I read a feature request on github. Let's say something like this dialogue happend:

    $ Pete: Hi, can I have compatibility with tool 'x'
    $ Hanky: We're trying to have a small codebase. Would you mind commenting what benefits tool 'x' has?
    $ Hanky closes feature request

Anything wrong here? Nope, objectively and without any form of emotions the feature request was handled pretty effectively.
The requestor has a chance to comment and reopen right?

Still I wonder why, by now 18 months later, Pete did not respond... Maybe he didn't care from the beginning, or maybe he
was too demotivated to continue...

For this post I **assume** he was demotivated because that fits the message I wanted to share for a while now.

Let's zoom in a bit and apply the sender / receiver pattern 
([Shannon-Weaver model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Weaver_model)). How can message for example become
offensive?

* The content IS offensive but neither the sender nor the receiver takes it that way
* The sender wants the message to be offensive and the receiver takes it as being offensive
* The sender wants the message to be offensive, but the receiver doesn't take it as being offensive
* The sender doesn't mean the message to be offensive, but the receiver takes it as being offensive

The first 2 are basically fine, either people don't understand there is no issue at all, or people agree to have an issue.
The 3rd one is easy to solve by the sender. The last one is more interesting, and one we need to tackle I think. Because
where could the receiver go to?
 
In many communities there are values like "not taking things offensive" or "humility". I like those bigtime, don't get
me wrong. But they hold a certain danger. We can not deny problems / negativity by waving it away and simply state we
only focus on the positive. This we only limit the community growth (or even shrink it). 

What if receiver actually **is** offended? What if receiver **is** demotivated? What if receiver **is** hurt? 
It happened to me personally multiple times. I would like to explain a bit why, and hope it will in some way help people
at a point. Either senders or receivers.

Let's zoom in to Pete. Pete is a part of a community. His feature request is a contribution, and one being done in plain
sight. World wide public. Maybe Pete is introvert and uncertain, he might have trouble stepping up. And then on a saturday
morning he sends in the feature request. I think at this point Pete is on a really vulnerable position. He's stepping out,
raising his head. Those situations can either make or break people, and many people tend to forget that.

I think a response taken neutral by Pete can be seen as 0 or 1 point, a response taken positively can easily be 2, 3 or
even more points. A negative one though easily put him back loads of points. And in the above example the worst situation
would be that Pete would read this message as a disqualification of him as a person because he is different because he
is using tool 'x' which the sender (possibly an authority / spokesmen of the community) does not like / see a usecase for.
This basically means he might think he's differnt, and does not fit the community.

Yes, I know... It's an extreme. But please shift more of the "take it positive" to the sender side of the story... Do not
hide yourself as sender behind the "the receiver should understand I meant it positively". Please...

Why? Well... Because... Because you simply might not know the context of the receiver. His knowledge, skills, certainty
about his question, or whatever. In my opinion this means you've to take great care of how you're crafting responses.

If you doubt a usecase, then don't say: "I don't see the usecase.". Extend the message... Short messages are easily taken
the wrong way. Try to explore the person behind the message. Picture him in your mind, accept the person. Think about how
valuable people are, and then start writing your kind response.

Accept the idea, welcome people, and then heavily doubt the usecase if you like. And now I'm not going to preach that my
communication style is great, but a response like this might have changed Petes day and might have lead to a longer conversation:

    Hi Pete, awesome that you use this software and good to see people trying to match it with tools we do not support yet.
    I personally are not a user of tool 'x' and I am sure you understand we try to keep the codebase small so mainteance is easier.
    Can you give me some more information about why you use tool 'x' and not one of the other alternatives for the platform you work on?

    I'd like hearing from you, I'll keep the issue open for the next week. If I don't hear back from you by then I'll close the issue to
    keep the issue tracker clean.
    
    Greetz,
    Hanky

And again, yes... I understand typing more text in hundreds of issues can be a burden. And yes, I also have had PR's
where I had a hard time trying to see the reasoning and not doubting the persons understanding of the code. But I am
convinced we are in (opensource) communities for the people, not only for the tools.  

Let's welcome the persons, and see their contributions as a part of their personality as such.
