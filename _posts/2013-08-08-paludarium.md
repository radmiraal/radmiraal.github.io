Oh, my little pet project... In 2012 [Robert Lemke](http://robertlemke.com/) already kindly announced this project in
the [T3CON keynote](http://t3con12de.typo3.org/). I'm working an a Flow based weather machine... And although it's still
very much in the 'thinking about it' phase, it didn't really get out of my mind.

This whole weather machine is of course not a machine which will start lightning in Stuttgart as I wish, but it will be
a [paludarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paludarium). Which is basically an aquarium with a land part. It will be the
replacement for my current aquarium, and will probably host some frogs in the end.

The whole thinking started when I found [Paluweb](http://paluweb.nl/). This guy is now working on version 2 of his
paludarium, and he uses weather feeds supplied by weather stations to simulate the weather in his paludarium. But what
if this could be taken over the top? And, what if we can somehow base this on Flow and put Flow to the test? How to link
a lighting system to my mobile phone, and how can I challenge myself to learn about hardware controllers, water flows,
lighting and rain systems.

Decided so far: it will be 140 cm wide, about 2 meters high and will contain about 300 liters of water... And as I'm
lazy: I want to be able to control water replacement, raining, weather, lightning and maybe even feeding using my
mobile phone... Bringing the web into my living room, and if you're nice I could make an online Neos donation system
giving you lightning strike orders in return ;-) With live stream of course :-)

I like to think outside the box, and from time to time I need a challenge to have a different view on the stuff I work
on. I plan to start actively blogging about the stuff I do in this regard, like selecting the hardware I use and the way
I connect for example Flow in this whole system. So, stay tuned!
