It has been a while since I had a blog, but with a maturing Neos and a Blog plugin available it is about time to blog
again...

I really plan to post regular updates here, about several subjects but mostly TYPO3 Flow, TYPO3 Neos and probably
Emberjs, Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance.

No big surprises there I guess, as most people will know me because either one of those topics. But hey, maybe I'll
throw in a bass or volleyball at some point.

For now I hope you like my new, plain & simple home on the web. Of course this new home is fully based on Neos, are you
planning a new home too? Get in touch to see what Neos has to offer to you!

To get inspiration for blog subjects I did a quick poll on twitter a while ago. Topics like building a Neos blog, how to
handle Neos as an integrator and Emberjs are on the agenda because of that. If you've a request, let me know by
commenting... I'll try to follow up those requests as much as possible.

Cya around!
