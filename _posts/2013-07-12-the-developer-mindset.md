Over the years I've become intrigued by the mindset of people I work with. Do you know coworkers that fail from the
beginning of the job and communicate in a negative way all day? Or the over positive communication of a developer who
never ever made a deadline? Or the quiet developer, absorbing negativity and slowly closes himself for the team? Or the
poison spread by tiny little sentences, over and over again, by a bomb in disguise waiting to demolish the project?

O, what a negative focus... Of course there are also other examples. The guy never ever saying one negative word... The
guy countering all negativity and motivating the full team... The guy able to push the team over their limits and
improving the members to levels they could never think of... And so on...

I always try to see in what mindset I work. I don't think someone fits in just one of those profiles, but traverses from
one mindset into the other. Recognising your state of mind, and trying to move away from negativity is important. To be
honest I also fail in this regard, but understanding the problem opens the way to a solution.

There are two major aspects in all those profiles. Negativity and positivity. And one of those is really strong. One
drop of negativity can hurt the most positive people, and it's almost impossible to make someone who has a negative
mindset a positive contribution to your team. If those people only knew... You hear them moaning a lot, and often this
ends up in people starting to ignore them. And this gets worse, as they moan more if they feel they aren't heard, which
leads to even more people ignoring, and so on...

I wish all people the chance to work with people instead of fighting their own little war against their own negative
inner me. To enable growth and the feeling of recognition and respect. Not just for their work, but as a human being.
And this counts for work, but also in open source communities (even between communities) and whatever situation in which
you still interact with people.

Don't let negativity eat you from the inside. Open up, allow positivity and express creativity. Do you see you traversed
to a negative mindset? Step up, explain why, and clear it up!

Just a thought...
